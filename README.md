Have made a basic sneaker app which consists of 3 screens
screen 1 -> Dashboard screen which shows list of items
screen 2 -> Detail screen which shows the selected item in detail
screen 3 -> Cart screen, which shows the items added in the cart

Have used a single activity with MVVM architecture.
Platform - Android
Language used -> Kotlin and Java

UI -> UI is designed with the help of XMl, have also used the help of data binding, Navigation Components.
DB -> For storing data locally, have used Room DB.
API-> for API calls have used google's recommended network bound resource(as of now all the data is stored locally with the help of json, but groundwork has been done to facilitate easy integration of api.
